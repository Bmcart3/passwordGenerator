# passwordGenerator
This is the password generator project. Simply click the Generate Password button and answer the prompts to receive a randomly generated password that includes whichever characters
you select.


The third assignment in the bootcamp consisted of creating a password generator which required user input.
This required a lot of basic javascript knowledge but the difficult part was combining the many different aspects of the language to get the desired result.
Understanding variables, functions, arrays, for loops, and if statement was required to complete the project the way I did. I am sure there are more efficient ways to reach
the same end result and I look forward to learning more about it in the future.
It was very satisfying completing this project but at the same time it was a bit stressful as the challenges are ramping up quickly!
